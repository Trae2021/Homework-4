I worked independently on this assignment. I am not sure what is meant by workflow, but I simply read the questions while working on RStudio. I wrote my responses as notes on the RMarkdown file alongside the code that I used to plot graphs and answer the questions. Whenever I struggled with parts of the assignment, I looked back at the slides as well as helpful coding websites on the internet. Once I had plotted all the graphs and marked down my answers, I exported all of my graphs to a folder and then formatted them on a Word document so that I could submit a PDF of my graphs. Finally, I uploaded my files to Github for submission and added this file detailing my workflow and other details.
